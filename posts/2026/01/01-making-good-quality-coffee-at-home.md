# Making Good Quality Coffee at Home
People like coffee and drink it every day, sometimes even multiple times a day. If you buy coffee at a cafe or coffee shop, it'll cost you a lot of money. Wouldn't it be better to save some money by making coffee yourself? You might think, "Well, easy, I can buy instant coffee from the supermarket and mix it with hot water in a cup." That's easy, but wouldn't it be even better to make higher quality coffee from coffee beans and still make it quickly? I mean, similar quality to a cafe, but without needing an expensive machine.

There are ways you can make coffee at home using just a few pieces of equipment. Today, I'm going to share what I think is the easiest way to make coffee at home using a French press. 

## Equipment
1. French press (coffee press)
2. Electric kettle
3. Manual coffee grinder
4. Coffee beans

All of these you can buy online at an affordable price. The French press, electric kettle, and manual coffee grinder are one-time purchases that will last you a very long time. I've had mine for more than 5 years already, and they're still doing their job very well. In Thailand, you can easily buy coffee beans online. They grow coffee in the northern part of Thailand. There are a lot of options out there, and importantly, they are cheap. A bag of 250g coffee beans could cost less than 150 Baht. If you buy a bigger bag, it would be even cheaper.

## How to make coffee using a French press?
1. Boil water using the kettle.
2. While waiting for the water to boil, grind the coffee beans using the grinder. The grinder should have a manual to set up the grind size. You should set the grind size to match the French press (coarse grind).
3. Pour the ground coffee into the French press and follow with the boiled water. How much coffee beans and boiled water should you use? I suggest you experiment yourself, because each person has their own preference. It might take you several attempts to find your ideal ratio. But once you know your preference, it'll be very easy to make coffee every time.

I can complete all of these steps in just 5 minutes. It might not be as quick as instant coffee, but for me, this is fast enough while still making good quality coffee.


## Coffee bean roast level
I prefer drinking light to medium roast because I like the fruity taste. The taste is less bitter and has a pleasant sourness at the same time.

But it depends on your preference—you may like dark roast or super dark roast, and that's okay. People like different things.

## Why I like making coffee myself
I like to try and explore different kinds of coffee and the different processes they use to make coffee beans. For instance, Honey process, Dry process, Washed process, and many more. Those different processes give different tastes.

Lastly, I want to help the farmers who grow coffee. Direct sales to customers are better than selling to middlemen, right? If we buy their products directly, they get more profit margin, and that's what I want to support.
